# Lawn Tractor

This repository aims to compile the work and software for self driving a lawn tractor, it's our first community project and was suggested by a rancher in Texas, Al Jones. As an example of implementation we have automated a small lawn tractor, using low-cost open source components to learn the principles of robotics.  The widely available lawn tractor platform with many attachments and open source approach reduces the barrier of entry of using robotics in agriculture.

From this community initiative we obtained the following products and tools:
* **[Lawn Tractor Simulator](simulator.md).** A [stage_ros](http://wiki.ros.org/stage_ros) implementation, that is a great training tool for learning ROS in an agricultural environment and with lawn tractor. At the Lawn Tractor Simulator page you will find all the imformation.
